Update this file.

To cause code to be tested in the console, code fence it like this:

```tut
val l = List(1,2,3)
l.map(_ * 3)
```

The resulting tutorial file will be put onto the website as a scala block and will show the results of the expressions.  See the CONTRIBUTING.md doc for more details.
